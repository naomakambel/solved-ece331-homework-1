 <li>Regarding the 6 classes of computers:</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Please provide one example computer for each class.</li>

 <li>Please discuss what additional features we care about in each class of computers, in addition to fast speed. (Hint: the additional features may include energy efficiency, cost, form factor, etc.).</li>

 <li>Please discuss an additional class of computers you can think of and why you think they are “computers”; alternatively, you can discuss a specific computer example, which belongs to 1 of the 6 classes but was not discussed in the lecture, and explain why you think it belongs to that class.</li>

</ul>

<ol start="2">

 <li>Please answer the following questions regarding the 5-component generic computer architecture:</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>What are the 5 components and their relationship?</li>

 <li>The textbook provided an example of disassembled smartphone. Can you please describe what parts of the smartphone are corresponding to the 5 components?</li>

 <li>In addition to the smartphone, can you please describe the 5 components for another class of computer? In that case, which of the 5 components are dramatically different from the smartphone and why?</li>

</ul>

<ol start="3">

 <li>Suppose you have two processors that have the following parameters for frequency and CPI.</li>

</ol>




<table width="424">

(1) If you are asked to execute a program with the following instruction mix, which processor would be faster? Please justify your answer quantitatively.

<ul>

 <li>ALU Instructions: 40%</li>

 <li>Branch Instructions: 20%</li>

 <li>Memory Load Instructions: 40%</li>

</ul>

(2) Suppose you can double the performance of branch instructions by using a dynamic branch prediction scheme for both processors. How much faster is each processor when executing the above program?

<ol start="4">

 <li>Regarding the “7 great ideas in computer architecture”, please note that the 1<sup>st</sup> edition of the textbook actually had the 8<sup>th</sup> great idea listed as “Designing for Moore’s Law”.</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>What is Moore’s law?</li>

 <li>Please comment on why the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of the textbook removed this 8<sup>th</sup> great idea.</li>

 <li>What impacts does this new situation of Moore’s Law pose on the advancements of memory and processor, and what might be the possible solutions?</li>

</ul>
